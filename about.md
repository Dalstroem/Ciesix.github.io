My name is Dennis Dalstr√∏m, and this is my personal blog. Here I write about programming, software development and other awesome things.

I'm a professional programmer living in Horsens, Denmark. When I'm not neck deep in code, I enjoy gaming, reading, watching movies, good food and beer.

I have worked as a programmer since 2012, but coded since 2002. I still remember my first website, which was mostly about my computer and it's specifications. Today I work mainly with C# and .Net, and really loving it. I have always loved creating something out of nothing, that others can appreciate and make use off.

## About this blog

The purpose of this blog, is to be a conduit. A way for me to write about all things software related, to help others (but mostly myself), to have a better understanding of the bundled pieces of code I make.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Coded with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/).
- Build on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), simple, blog-aware, static sites.
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
